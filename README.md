# MicroStrategy REST API Playground

## What is the Playground?

MicroStrategy REST API Playground is a place you can see live demos of our REST API, API specifications, and code examples. You can also play with it without writing a single line of code.   

You can access it at https://www.postman.com/microstrategysdk/.  If you are not familiar Postman interface, be sure to check out [documents](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/) on Postman's learning center. 


There are two collections in the workspace:

* MicroStrategy REST API: Use it as API Documentation. It contains examples and built-in scripts to save the context information after some requests, such as authToken, userId. 
* MicroStrategy REST API Workflows: It contains workflow examples. You can pick a folder and run all the requests. 

You need to pick an environment to run the requests. There are two environments shipped. 
* demo.microstrategy.com: It contains the connection information to the demo environment. A guest user only has limited assess to the environment, hence not all requests will pass. 
* A template for cloud environment. You can make a copy and change the connection information.
